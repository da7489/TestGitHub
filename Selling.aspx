                    Occasionally, one can see &quot;For Sale By Owner&quot; signs, and some owners think that 
                    selling their own home will not only save them money, but believe they have an 
                    advantage over the sellers that have their home listed by a reputable Real 
                    Estate sales professional. Before you decide to take on this very important and 
                    legally complicated process…remember not even most Real Estate Lawyer&#39;s 
                    recommend selling your own home yourself in today&#39;s market. Here are a few of 
                    the reasons why:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    1. You are limiting your exposure to potential buyers (less than 10% of what a 
                    good real estate broker will generate) which theoretically means your home will 
                    take ten to fifteen times longer to sell on the market.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. The longer a home is on the market the lower the selling price is. Why? 
                    Because most buyers think that if the home has not sold after this long... there 
                    must be something wrong with the home.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. The selling/buying process begins AFTER the buyer leaves your home. Most 
                    sellers think that all it takes is for someone to see their home, fall in love 
                    with the great decor... and the offer automatically will follow. Remember that 
                    the buying process begins after they leave your home. If a real estate sales 
                    representative does not represent the buyer, and they are looking on their 
                    own…they usually leave the home and start to talk themselves out of the buying 
                    process. Real estate professionals are trained on how to overcome buyers 
                    remorse--a very common occurrence.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    4. Because of the limited exposure you will very likely end up with a lower 
                    selling price. Remember, in order to generate the highest price possible for 
                    your home… selling means exposure. You need the maximum exposure possible, to 
                    generate the highest price possible.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    5. Most buyers find it extremely awkward to negotiate or even to talk directly 
                    with sellers and therefore avoid FSBO properties.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    6. Lack of negotiating experience and lack of pertinent information often will 
                    result in a lower selling price, or worse yet, a bungled contract and possible 
                    lawsuits.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    7. The majority of qualified buyers are working with experienced real estate 
                    professionals.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    8. Many serious buyers will pass by a FSBO home merely because they recognize 
                    that it is not in the real estate mainstream, this can some times make them 
                    wary.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    9. As most local buyers now retain an experienced real estate sales person to 
                    represent them as their buyer-agency, you will probably be negotiating against 
                    an experienced professional.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    10. Expected savings in broker&#39;s fees will also be greatly reduced if you offer 
                    a selling commission to entice real estate sales representatives to bring 
                    potential buyers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    11. If you are planning to use a Lawyer to help you negotiate the offer, then 
                    your lawyer&#39;s fees will be considerably higher.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    12. Only real estate sales representatives have access to the up-to-date market 
                    information. News reports cannot approach the timeliness or specificity 
                    available to real estate sales people. Further, real estate sales 
                    representatives are involved in home sales much more frequently than the average 
                    homeowner is. This familiarity leads to a degree of expertise that provides an 
                    edge on negotiating and successful selling.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    13. You only pay the commission to the real estate broker, if they successfully 
                    sell your home at the price you are happy with.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    14. Accepting an offer is one thing, ensuring a safe and successful closing is 
                    quite another. Real estate transactions usually always have problems on closing. 
                    At times, expecting the Buyers and Sellers Lawyer&#39;s to fight it out or resolve 
                    the problems, can sometimes mean the deal is lost. This is the time that your 
                    experienced real estate professional, can be the most important. Your Real 
                    Estate professional can act as a great mediator. Lawyers MUST act only on their 
                    client&#39;s instructions and are not paid to negotiate.</div>
